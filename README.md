# solar-challenge-week1
This repo contains my works as part of the Kifiya's AI Mastery training program Week 0 challenges.

## Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gemechisworku/solar-challenge-week1.git
    cd solar-challenge-week1
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
Then you are good to go! Atleast for now.
